Keepers *keep *the Drift network healthy.

### Rewards

For matching orders, Keepers receive a portion of the taker fee.

For cancelling orders (that can be cancelled see [Advanced Orders FAQ](<../Trading/7 Advanced Orders FAQ.md>)), Keepers will receive the `cancel_order_fee` on the state.

### Future Work

30d fill volume for keepers is tracked on-chain via `UserStats`, allowing for logic to reward consistent keepers with a larger multiplier on rewards.&#x20;
