_For more information on our fee tiers, please see _[Standard Fee Schedule](docId:Pb5iAugojWFmFImjFQfQ4)_._

The below fee schedule details the rebates provided to Market Makers that have their orders filled by other users on the platform.&#x20;

In order to ensure an order is a maker order, it will need the 'post only' flag. Otherwise even resting orders can match as a taker.

The current incentive program will be subject to change. All changes will be reflected in this schedule.&#x20;
