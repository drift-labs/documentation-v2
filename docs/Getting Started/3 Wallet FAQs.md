### Do I need SOL in my wallet?&#x20;

Yes, all interactions with the platform will require a small amount of SOL for the gas fees on the blockchain.&#x20;

### Does it cost money to create an account?&#x20;

Yes. The Solana blockchain requires a small amount of SOL to store the state of your positions on Drift. This costs 0.035 SOL. This is called **Rent**. This fee is only paid on the creation of a new account and each subaccount.&#x20;

***Note***: To trade on Drift, you'll eventually need more than 0.035 SOL to facilitate and approve transactions.

### Will I get my rent back?&#x20;

Yes. If at any time you decide to close your account you will get the rent back for that associated account.&#x20;

### Does my wallet support versioned transactions?

Versioned transactions need to be turned on to use Drift's Swaps feature. Read more about versioned transactions and which wallets support it [here](https://docs.drift.trade/versioned-transactions).
