Drift Protocol is also a decentralised money markets protocol that supports the borrowing and lending of assets.&#x20;

As a decentralised money markets protocol, you can:

-   deposit assets into Drift Protocol and earn yield; or

-   borrow assets deposited by other Lenders at a variable interest rate.

Lenders provide liquidity to the market to earn yield on their assets, while borrowers are able to borrow from available liquidity pools in an over-collateralised fashion. Any interest earned from lending is vested immediately and automatically compounds.

**Example 1 - Borrowing:**

-   _You have 100 SOL worth $10,000 USD. You want access to USDC however you don't want to sell your SOL. _

What can you do?&#x20;

You can deposit your SOL into Drift Protocol and borrow up to 50% of the value you deposited in USDC. For 100 SOL worth $10,000 USD, you can borrow up to $5,000 USDC.&#x20;

The borrowed amount can then be used to do anything, including to get leveraged exposure to particular assets via spot trading.&#x20;

**Example 2 - Lending:**

-   _You have 100 SOL worth $10,000 USD. You have conviction in SOL and you're not going to sell any time soon but you also don't want it to sit around idly doing nothing._

What can you do?&#x20;

You can deposit your SOL into Drift Protocol. The SOL you deposited can be lent out to Borrowers in the protocol. In return for lending out your assets, you'll earn a variable Deposit APR.

More information on lending APY will be released soon.
